Please evaluate this rent control policy by answering the following questions. Respond in JSON format using a 0 to 1 scale, where 1 means **most restrictive** (strong tenant protections) and 0 means **least restrictive** (landlord-friendly).

Questions:

1. **max_rent_increase**: What is the maximum annual rent increase? 
   - Return a number between 0 and 1 based on how strict the cap is.
   - A 0% increase = 1.0 (most restrictive); 10% or higher = 0.0 (least restrictive).
   - Use intermediate values for anything in between.
   - If the cap is CPI-tied, use 0.5. If no cap is found, assume 0.0.

2. **sf_exempt**: Are single-family homes exempt from rent control?
   - Return 1.0 if single-family homes are **not exempt**..
   - Return 0.0 if **any sf or single family exemptions** are mentioned.
   - Use 0.5 if ambiguous or partial.
   - Example: If the law applies to all units regardless of structure type, return 1.0.

3. **cpi_tied**: Is the *base* rent increase explicitly tied to CPI?
   - Ignore vacancy decontrol CPI references.
   - Return 1.0 if the main rent cap is fixed (not CPI-tied).
   - Return 0.0 if the cap is CPI-tied.

4. **new_construction_exempt**: Are newly constructed units exempt from rent control?
   - Return 1.0 if **new construction is covered** (most restrictive).
   - Return 0.0 if **new construction is exempt**.
   - Use 0.5 if unclear.

5. **hardship_appeals**: Are landlords allowed to request rent increases above the cap for hardship or financial reasons?
   - Return 1.0 if **no hardship appeals are allowed** (most restrictive).
   - Return 0.0 if **hardship appeals are explicitly allowed**.
   - Use 0.5 if unclear.

6. **vacancy_decontrol**: Does the ordinance allow landlords to raise rent by more than the regular cap when a tenant moves out (i.e., vacancy decontrol)?
   - Return 1.0 if **vacancy decontrol is NOT allowed** (most restrictive).
   - Return 0.0 if **vacancy decontrol IS allowed**, even if the increase is temporary, tied to CPI, or "until re-rented".
   - Return 0.0 automatically if the phrase **“vacancy decontrol”** appears anywhere in the text.
   - Use 0.5 if ambiguous or limited.
